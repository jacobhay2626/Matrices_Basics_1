DISCLAIMER: 

This project is not completely original and I used a lot of my notes and understanding from the online course: "Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization" by Imperial College London. 
My goal is to use the concepts in this notebook in my own, original work but wanted to have this in my portfolio regardless!
